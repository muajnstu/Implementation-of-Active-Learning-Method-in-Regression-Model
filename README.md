# Implementation-of-Active-Learning-Method-in-Regression-Model
 Active learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that aims to improve model
 efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data required for training. #It identifies
 and prioritizes the most informative or uncertain samples for labeling, ensuring that
 each labeled data point maximally contributes to the modelâ€™s performance. Active
 learning operates iteratively, where the model learns from labeled data, identifies
 areas of high uncertainty, and requests labels for those specific data points.
 In predicting medical insurance costs, active learning can prioritize cases where the
 relationship between variables (e.g., BMI and medical charges) is ambiguous. For
 example, a non-smoker with a high BMI might yield a wide range of potential costs,
 making their data point particularly informative for labeling.

  In this study, the US Health Insurance Dataset, sourced from the Kaggle repository, is
 utilized as the primary data source. The dataset comprises 1,338 records and includes
 essential demographic and health-related attributes, such as age, BMI, smoking sta
tus, and insurance charges, which serve as the target variable. It is pre-cleaned and
 contains no missing values, ensuring its suitability for machine learning applications.
 This dataset provides a realistic and comprehensive foundation for studying health in
surance premium prediction, capturing trends across diverse demographic and health
 factors.
 
 Here, active learning is applied to optimize the training of regression models
 for predicting health insurance premiums. By selecting data points with the highest
 uncertainty or the most significant expected impact on model parameters, the ap
proach reduces labeling costs and improves prediction accuracy. This methodology
 is particularly relevant in resource-constrained environments like Bangladesh, where
 labeled datasets are limited.
